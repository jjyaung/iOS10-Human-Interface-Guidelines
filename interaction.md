# 3D Touch

3D Touch adds an additional dimension to touch-based interaction. On supported devices, people can access additional functionality by applying varying levels of pressure to the touchscreen. Apps can respond by displaying a menu, showing additional content, or playing an animation. People donâ€™t need to learn new gestures to interact with 3D Touch. They quickly discover the additional interactive dimension when they press lightly on the screen and get a response.
