# 設計準則

身為一位行動應用程式設計師，您有機會發表卓越的產品，並且在應用程式商店(App Store)上發光發熱。要作到這樣，您必須對其品質與功能上有高水準的要求。

iOS與其他平台的差異，主要來自於以下三點：
Clarity. Throughout the system, text is legible at every size, icons are precise and lucid, adornments are subtle and appropriate, and a sharpened focus on functionality motivates the design. Negative space, color, fonts, graphics, and interface elements subtly highlight important content and convey interactivity.

空間、顏色、字型、圖形和介面元素，以確保突顯重要的內容與兼具互動性。
Deference. Fluid motion and a crisp, beautiful interface help people understand and interact with content while never competing with it. Content typically fills the entire screen, while translucency and blurring often hint at more. Minimal use of bezels, gradients, and drop shadows keep the interface light and airy, while ensuring that content is paramount.

Depth. Distinct visual layers and realistic motion convey hierarchy, impart vitality, and facilitate understanding. Touch and discoverability heighten delight and enable access to functionality and additional content without losing context. Transitions provide a sense of depth as you navigate through content.

當思考您移動應用程式的特性時，將下方的準則謹記在心，有助於
To maximize impact and reach, keep the following principles in mind as you imagine your app’s identity.
在想像行動應用程式的獨特性時將下列準則謹記在

Aesthetic Integrity
Aesthetic integrity represents how well an app’s appearance and behavior integrate with its function. For example, an app that helps people perform a serious task can keep them focused by using subtle, unobtrusive graphics, standard controls, and predictable behaviors. On the other hand, an immersive app, such as a game, can deliver a captivating appearance that promises fun and excitement, while encouraging discovery.
